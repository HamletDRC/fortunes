We'd love for you to contribute to make `fortunes` even better than it is today! 

To contribute, fork the repository, make changes in your fork, then submit the changes back to this repository as a new Pull Request.

 * **Do not include the `.dat` files in your pull request.**

We only ask that you follow these files:
- run `make` to ensure the build still works
- run `fortune [path/to/the/changed/file/s]` to make sure fortune can read the files
- follow the [conventional commit message format](https://www.conventionalcommits.org/) for all commit messages.
